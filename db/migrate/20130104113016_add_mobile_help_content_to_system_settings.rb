      <h3>Merchants Compete to Show You Offers</h3>

      <p>The winning merchants give you their best offers because they are vested in winning your business and donâ€™t want to lose.</p>

      <h3>Cash Back Shopping</h3>
      <p>When you initiate an auction you will have the opportunity to view instant cash back offers from over 300 of the top merchants in the United States - up to 20% cash back. The cash back savings are for anything you purchase from that merchant, not only the item for which you initiated an auction.</p>
      <p class=\"important\">NOTE: Due to technical reasons, some merchants still are not enabled to give cash back via the mobile app. You will still see these cash back offers, but you may be directed to login to you MuddleMe account via a PC or MAC to take advantage of these earnings.</p>
